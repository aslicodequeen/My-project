# My-project
Hello,
I am Krupa Jani, a young freelance designer with over 5 years of experience. After finishing my studies in 2010, I started my career as a front-end developer. I joined free code camp to enhance my skills, perseverance and desire to learn more have afforded me the opportunities to become a freelance UI Designer and front-end web developer.
